actually this is more like a dev log hahhhaha

20200101 omg it's a new decade and i haven't done shit yet
i have the skeleton of the bot. i can store some input into db and display it.
now i need to change the input into the format i actually need: the hashtags, and then append time to it, 
then store it in the db, then make the webpage read it and display it.

The title page should be "Use me senpai ^^"
and there is a little box that says "topics to follow:" to get input
and a display on the right that lists "currently following"

{ "topic" : "testuser1"}
